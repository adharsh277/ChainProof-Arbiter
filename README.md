**Chain Proof Arbiter is a multi-agent disagreement resolver built on Cortensor that detects AI consensus instability and anchors disputed outcomes on-chain.**

---

## 🎯 Overview

**ChainProof Arbiter** is a research-grade multi-agent blockchain intelligence system that provides verifiable, unbiased risk analysis through:

- **🤖 Multi-Agent Coordination**: Specialized agents (Risk Analysis, Contract Behavior, Transaction Pattern) working collaboratively
- **🔄 Redundant Inference (PoI)**: Multiple inference runs per agent to detect inconsistencies and ensure reliability
- **✅ Unbiased Validation (PoUW)**: Rubric-based validator scoring to eliminate subjective bias
- **📊 Real-Time Intelligence**: Consensus timelines, stability indices, and disagreement heatmaps
- **🔐 Cryptographic Evidence**: Immutable proof bundles with cross-run consistency verification

This is not a demo—it's a production-ready platform for institutional-grade blockchain analysis.

---

## � Agent Execution Loop

ChainProof Arbiter implements a repeatable multi-agent workflow:

- **User initializes arbitration session** → Query submitted with analysis type and context
- **Agent dispatches inference across multiple models via Cortensor** → Each specialized agent runs 2+ inference passes
- **Cross-run variance and divergence are measured** → Semantic alignment and consistency scores computed
- **If instability exceeds threshold, escalation is triggered** → Low confidence or high disagreement triggers re-runs
- **Arbitration result is committed on-chain** → Final decision bundled with cryptographic proof
- **Evidence bundle is generated for auditability** → Complete chain of reasoning with session IDs and validator scores

This loop ensures every decision is verifiable, repeatable, and backed by multi-agent consensus.

---

### 🏗️ Architecture

#### **Proof of Insight (PoI)**
Redundant inference runs across multiple agents to:
1. Detect hallucinations through cross-validation
2. Measure consistency across inference runs
3. Flag low-confidence or contradictory outputs

#### **Proof of Unbiased Work (PoUW)**
Rubric-based validation system:
- Predefined scoring criteria (accuracy, completeness, relevance)
- Objective 0-10 rating per criterion
- Justification required for each score
- Overall score computed from weighted averages

#### **Arbitration Bundle Structure**
```json
{
  "task": "Query string",
  "taskId": "unique-id",
  "agent_a_result": { ... },
  "agent_b_result": { ... },
  "disagreement_analysis": {
    "agreement": true/false,

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/adharsh277/ChainProof-Arbiter.git
cd ChainProof-Arbiter

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
npm start
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the next available port if 3000 is in use).

### Local Router (Real Mode)

To connect the UI to the local router server (router-server.py) instead of simulation mode:

1. Ensure your environment file has these values:
  ```dotenv
  # Cortensor Router Configuration
  CORTENSOR_ROUTER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5010
  CORTENSOR_API_KEY=YOUR_LOCAL_API_KEY

  # Development Settings
  NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_MODE=true
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SIMULATION_MODE=false
  ```

2. Start the router server with the same API key:
  ```bash
  API_KEY=YOUR_LOCAL_API_KEY python router-server.py
  ```

3. Start the Next.js dev server:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

4. Verify real connection:
  ```bash
  curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/router-status
  ```
  Expect `"mode":"real"` and `"status":"ready"`.

### Simulation Mode (No API Key)

If you do not want to run the router server, enable simulation mode:

```dotenv
NEXT_PUBLIC_SIMULATION_MODE=true
```

This uses the simulated client and returns realistic demo responses without authentication.

### Troubleshooting

- **401 Invalid API key**: The router server validates the `Authorization` header. Make sure `API_KEY` for router-server.py matches `CORTENSOR_API_KEY` in your `.env.local`.
- **Port already in use**: Next.js will fall back to 3001/3002. Check the terminal output for the active port.
- **Router not responding**: Ensure the router server is running on `http://127.0.0.1:5010` and that your `CORTENSOR_ROUTER_URL` matches.

### Testing & Replay

```bash
# Run reproducible analysis via CLI
npm run replay -- --task "Analyze 0x1234..." --type token-safety

# Replay from existing evidence bundle
npm run replay -- --file evidence-task-12345.json

# See all options
npm run replay -- --help
```

## ⚙️ Cortensor Integration

ChainProof Arbiter is built on **Cortensor Sessions** for verifiable, decentralized multi-agent execution.

### **Uses Cortensor Sessions for Execution**

Every inference request goes through Cortensor's routing layer:

```typescript
// Agent → Cortensor Router → Model → Cortensor → Agent
const { response, sessionId, latencyMs } = await callCortensorRouter(prompt)
```

### **Leverages Decentralized Inference Routing**

- Cortensor Router v1 distributes inference across decentralized model providers
- Load-balanced execution ensures no single point of failure
- Multiple models queried simultaneously for consensus
- Session-based tracking for auditability

### **Multi-Run Validation for Cross-Model Agreement**

- 2+ inference passes per agent to detect hallucinations
- Cortensor sessions logged with unique IDs (e.g., `session-1708905123456-a3f9k2`)
- Cross-run consistency verification ensures reliable outputs
- Disagreement detected and flagged for escalation

### **Evidence Bundles Generated Per Session**

```json
{
  "evidence": {
    "session_ids": [
      "session-1708905123456-a3f9k2",
      "session-1708905124789-b7k2m9",
      "session-1708905126012-c9n4p1"
    ],
    "raw_outputs": ["...", "...", "..."],
    "validator_session_id": "val-1708905127445-d2q8r5"
  }
}
```

### **On-Chain Commitment for Final Arbitration**

- Arbitration results can be anchored to blockchain for immutability
- Evidence hashes committed on-chain for verifiable audit trail
- Integration with blockchain explorers for public verification
- Session IDs and timestamps ensure reproducibility

### **Environment Variables**

```bash
# .env.local
CORTENSOR_ROUTER_URL=https://router.cortensor.ai/v1
CORTENSOR_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.example.com/alerts
```

## 🛡️ Safety & Guardrails

ChainProof Arbiter implements **strict operational guardrails** to ensure responsible AI execution:

### **No Automatic On-Chain Commitment Without Divergence Threshold**

- Only results with confidence > 80% are eligible for on-chain commitment
- Divergence-triggered escalations prevent unreliable decisions from being anchored
- Manual review gate ensures human oversight of critical decisions
- Commitment happens only after validator score ≥ 7.0/10

### **Transparent Evidence Logging**

- **All decisions logged with session IDs** - Every analysis tracked from inception
- **Immutable proof bundles with timestamps** - Complete chain of reasoning preserved
- **Audit trail for regulatory compliance** - Ready for third-party verification
- **No hidden scoring mechanisms** - All rubric criteria and weights documented

### **Explicit Model Selection**

- User specifies analysis type (token-safety, contract-behavior, transaction-pattern)
- Model routing determined by Cortensor based on declared intent
- No silent fallback to alternative models without user notification
- Session IDs link to specific model versions for reproducibility

### **Autonomous Thresholds (Not Autonomous Execution)**

| Metric | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Agent Confidence** | < 60% | Escalate to human review |
| **Validator Score** | < 7.0/10 | Flag for manual oversight |
| **Risk Score** | > 85/100 | Trigger alert webhooks |
| **Agreement Score** | < 80% | Auto re-run analysis |

### **What This Agent REFUSES to Do**

❌ **Does not provide financial or investment advice**  
❌ **Does not execute on-chain transactions autonomously**  
❌ **Does not make trading recommendations**  
❌ **Blocks analysis of unsupported/untrusted chains**  
❌ **No hidden biases or undisclosed scoring adjustments**

### **Rate Limiting & Circuit Breakers**

- Maximum 100 requests/hour per API key
- Exponential backoff on Cortensor errors
- Request deduplication (5-minute window)
- Automatic circuit breaker if validator score cascades below 5.0/10

### **Escalation Policy**

When thresholds are exceeded:
1. **Low Confidence** → Human review required
2. **High Risk** → Alert sent via webhook + UI warning
3. **Agent Disagreement** → Additional validation run triggered
4. **Critical Risk (>90)** → Incident report generated automatically

---

## 🤖 Autonomous Continuation Logic

ChainProof Arbiter implements **agent loop continuation** — not just a one-shot pipeline.

### **How It Works**

After initial analysis completes, the system evaluates:

```typescript
interface ContinuationDecision {
  should_continue: boolean
  reason: string
  action: "rerun" | "escalate" | "alert" | "complete"
  triggered_by: "disagreement" | "low_confidence" | "high_risk" | "manual"
}
```

### **Continuation Rules**

1. **Disagreement Detection** (threshold: 80%)
   - If agents disagree → **Auto re-run** with 3rd validator
   - Logs reason: "Agent disagreement detected"

2. **Low Validator Score** (< 7.0)
   - If quality check fails → **Escalate** to human operator
   - Requires manual review before final decision

3. **Critical Risk** (> 85/100)
   - If high risk detected → **Trigger alert** webhooks
   - Sends notification to monitoring systems

4. **Low Confidence** (< 60%)
   - If agents uncertain → **Escalate** for review
   - Prevents false positives from low-quality inference

### **Example Flow**

```
User Query → Agents analyze → Disagreement detected (delta: 35)
  → Continuation: should_continue = true
  → Action: "rerun"
  → 3rd agent validates → Final arbitration
```

This transforms ChainProof from a **dashboard** into an **autonomous agent system**.

    }
  ]
}
```

## ⚡ Operational Workflows

ChainProof Arbiter generates **actionable operational outputs** for real-world blockchain monitoring:

### **Triggered Actions**

When thresholds are exceeded, the system automatically:

| Risk Level | Action Triggered | Output |
|------------|------------------|--------|
| **>85** | Webhook Alert | POST to monitoring system |
| **>90** | Incident Report | JSON summary + recommendations |
| **Low Confidence** | Escalation Ticket | Human review queue entry |
| **Disagreement** | Re-run Analysis | Additional validation pass |

### **Webhook Integration**

```typescript
// Example webhook payload
{
  "taskId": "task-...",
  "severity": "critical",
  "riskScore": 87.3,
  "timestamp": "2026-02-25T10:30:45.123Z",
  "recommendation": "Immediate investigation required",
  "evidence_url": "/api/download-evidence?id=task-..."
}
```

### **Use Case: DevOps Monitoring**

```
New Token Deployed → ChainProof analyzes → Risk: 92/100
  → Webhook sent to Slack/PagerDuty
  → Incident report generated
  → Security team alerted
```

This aligns ChainProof with the **"Real Operators"** track — not just analysis, but **operational response automation**.

---

## � Why This Matters

**AI systems today are opaque.** Chain Proof Arbiter ensures that high-impact decisions are structurally validated and publicly auditable through decentralized execution and on-chain anchoring.

Instead of trusting a single model's output, Arbiter deploys multiple agents, cross-validates their reasoning, measures disagreement, and anchors trusted results on-chain. Every decision is reproducible, verifiable, and backed by cryptographic proof.

This transforms AI from a **black box** into a **verifiable system** — essential for blockchain analysis, risk assessment, and any domain where trust must be earned, not assumed.
